# LuxDev-Data-Science-Botcamp
This is a repository consistoing of projects for the LuxDev Dara Science Bootcamp over 6 weeks.

## week 1 Project, Weather conditions
The noteboook labled weather is is the week 1 project.
The project is beginer based, wih a dataset of weather conditions.

The project involved pyhton code to find the below conditions:
*Find all records where the weather was exactly clear.
*Find the number of times the wind speed was exactly 4 km/hr.
*Check if there are any NULL values present in the dataset.
*Rename the column "Weather" to "Weather_Condition."
*What is the mean visibility of the dataset?
*Find the number of records where the wind speed is greater than 24 km/hr and visibility is equal to 25 km.
*What is the mean value of each column for each weather condition?
*Find all instances where the weather is clear and the relative humidity is greater than 50, or visibility is above 40.
*Find the number of weather conditions that include snow.

Also SQL code to find any of the above 4 conditions. The SQL file was executed on https://www.programiz.com/

## Week 2 Assignment
Using EDA, perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover interesting patterns, insights, and potential anomalies within the Weather dataset we used for week 1 Assignment.
Please address the following questions and tasks in your analysis:
1. Data Overview and Cleaning:
What are the key characteristics of the dataset? (e.g., number of records, features, data types)
Identify and handle any missing or null values. Describe your approach and reasoning.
Check for and address any duplicate records.
2. Statistical Summary:
Provide a statistical summary of the dataset (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical features.
Identify and describe any significant outliers in the data.
3. Data Visualization:
Create visualizations to show the distribution of key weather parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed).
Plot time series graphs to visualize trends over time. Highlight any notable patterns or seasonal variations.
Create correlation matrices and heatmaps to identify relationships between different weather parameters.
4. Weather Patterns and Trends:
Analyze and describe any trends or patterns you observe in the data. For instance, how do temperature and humidity vary across different seasons or months?
Investigate any anomalies or unusual patterns in the data. What might be the reasons for these anomalies?
5. Insights and Conclusions:
Summarize the key insights you have gained from your EDA. What are the most interesting or surprising findings?
How can these insights be useful for weather prediction or other practical applications?
6. Recommendations for Further Analysis:
Suggest areas for further analysis or additional data that might be useful to explore.
